                        PORTLAND, Maine — For liberal activists, it has been a punishing two years of protest, waging battles over health care, tax breaks, family separation, and Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Resistance, it turns out, is exhausting.

                        “People are getting burnt out,” said Marie Follayttar, a Portland artist who founded an activist group called Mainers for Accountable Leadership after the 2016 election.

                        If liberals are feeling increasingly beaten down by the never-ending demands of activism in the age of Trump, then perhaps no one is more dispirited than Maine activists, who for two years have been on the front lines of the nation’s most heated fights.</p>

                        Heavy, wet snow fell steadily across New England as the region slept, and is expected to continue to pile up 1-2 inches an hour through 6 a.m., prompting most Greater Boston public schools to cancel classes for Monday. Officials are warning that storm’s effect on the morning commute could be significant and are suggesting people work from home or stay off the roads until midmorning.

                        Downed tree limbs and power lines are increasingly likely due to wet snow, the weather service said. The Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency was reporting 8,602 customers were without power as of 5:45 a.m.

                        The National Weather Service was reporting 10 inches of snow had accumulated in Boston by 5:15 a.m.</p>

                        More than 50 years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination at a Memphis motel, and more than 60 years after King met his future spouse, Coretta Scott, through a mutual friend at Roxbury’s Twelfth Baptist Church, a Boston monument to the civil rights leader is one step closer to fruition.

                        King Boston, the organization established to memorialize the couple’s local legacy, plans to announce Monday it has selected “The Embrace,” by artist Hank Willis Thomas and MASS Design Group, after reviewing 126 submissions and whittling them down to five finalists.
